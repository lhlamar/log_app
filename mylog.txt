Hey aiden, if you're seeing this that means you typed my name as
one of your entries, which I'll assume means you're thinking
about me for one reason or another. I wanted to let you know
that I really care about you and miss you so much and haven't
really gone a day without thinking about you. I really hope you're doing well
but then there's another selfish part of me that hopes you
aren't just because I'm not and I don't want you to be doing
well without me. I know that's super selfish and dumb but it's true
which is so annoying. I was really missing you a lot today and wanted
to text you so bad and let you know that I was thinking about you
but I didn't because I know that you need space to get over me
so I'm doing this instead. I miss you so much though. I miss
your smile, I miss your laugh, I miss your annoying little bites, I
miss how freaking pretty you are. I hate how much I like your new
haircut because it is not making this easier for me lol but it
does look really good on you. I hope everything is going well with
school and the raptor center and all that. I also really hope you
don't move on from me to fast as I will likely not move too soon myself.
I know that's also selfish of me but it would really hurt me.
I know Sean and Mel broke up so a piece of me is worried that you
and Sean are gonna rebound with each other if you haven't already.
Anyways, if you do end up seeing this, some reassurance about that
would be really nice to hear from you. Anyways, just know I care
about you and I love you. That's all I think.
